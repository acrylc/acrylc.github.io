	<h2>[mah-yah] (noun)</h2>

	<span>I build elegant, holistic solutions, to craft memoriable human experiences. Iâ€™m fascinated with the intersection of high-tech, aesthetics and human cognition. Ultimately, I want to bridge the gap between action and intent.</span>

	<span>Currently, I build products at LinkedIn. I have previous experience in engineering, user experience and design.</span>
